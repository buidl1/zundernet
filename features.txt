Security features:
1. Wallet.dat encryption when going offline/stopping deamon (plan to move to persistent encryption mode).
2. Encrypted DB.

Wallet management features:
1. Categories, easy names and stats for addresses.
2. Create new address from specific seed.
3. Importing/exporting priv keys, addresses, view keys.

Conveniet features:
1. Database (being able to see historical transactions in and out even when deamon is off).
2. Signatures - after initial recognition if addr A sends tx with addr B - it will automatically recognize sender A/B. Sender/receiver recognitions (tx threading makes it more easy after initial validation) using reversed hash chain.
3. Address book with categories and view keys.
4. Channels/forums: ability to have multi people (public or private) chat with threading (user recognition). Only people who you share channel with will see messages. If you share view keys in public - anyone can see.

Future:
- persistent wallet encryption
- publishing channel to txt file (to be able to publish content in a website)
- public id - currently ID is generated per address in "send to" field and recognized this way in threads. It is possible however to make ID registation on a public channel to have single ID used and ecognized in any channel/conversation. More complicated but may be more convinient for most users. Currently each user will have multiple ID's between channels because "send to" addr of each channel is different.
